# Quote Generator with Typing Effect 

This is my project from the unit 5 of my frond-end developer study at the OpenClassrooms.

Requirements: 
- Build a random quote generator . 
- The quotes will be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence.
- The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call
- Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
- Choose between 2 types of quote generators (example: 3 sentence fragments [beginning, middle, and end])
- **additional**: typing effect 

Go to the quote generator: https://mario-sko.github.io/quote-generator/
